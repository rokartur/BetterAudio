## Licensing & Support license

BetterAudio is free to use with a solid set of core features. If you enjoy the app and want to **support its development**, you can purchase a **[Support license](https://buy.stripe.com/00w9AU6pp5pV7eNaeq7g400)**. Prices: 29.99 PLN, 7.99 EUR, 9.99 USD.

By buying a Support license you:

- **Support the project directly**
  - Help cover the cost of backend infrastructure, security work and ongoing maintenance.
  - Let the author spend more time polishing existing features and adding new ones.

- **Unlock extra premium features**
  - **Volume keys routing** – route the system volume keys to control the output you actually care about (e.g. a specific external device instead of the default one).
  - **Custom mute HUD position** – move the mute HUD to a custom position on your screen so it doesn’t overlap what you’re working on.
  - **Extended HUD display time** – increase how long HUDs stay visible, making it easier to see volume / mute / device changes at a glance.

  These premium options are clearly gated in the UI, so you always know what you unlock with a Support license.

- **Get a trial before you decide**
  - New users receive a time‑limited trial where premium features are fully unlocked.
  - After the trial ends, you can keep using the free core features or support the app by activating a license.

In short: **you don’t need a license to use BetterAudio**, but if you find it useful and want to help it grow, a Support license is the best way to say “thank you” — and you get some nice extra features in return.
